<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a dedicated and passionate 
  student in my final year, 
  pursuing dual degrees in 
  Applied Mathematics and 
  Software Engineering. 
  My academic journey has been 
  a challenging yet immensely 
  rewarding experience. 
  I have honed my analytical 
  skills through my studies in 
  Applied Mathematics, delving 
  deep into mathematical concepts 
  and their practical applications. 
  Simultaneously, my fascination 
  with technology and its limitless 
  potential led me to explore the world 
  of Software Engineering, where I have 
  acquired the knowledge and skills to 
  develop innovative solutions and software 
  applications.

<p>
  Throughout my academic career, 
  I have maintained a strong commitment to
   excellence, striving for a deep understanding 
   of both mathematical theories and software 
   development practices. I have successfully 
   tackled complex problem-solving tasks and 
   coding challenges, and I am enthusiastic 
   about contributing to the intersection of 
   mathematics and technology. With a strong
    foundation in both disciplines,
     I am excited to embark on a journey where I can leverage my expertise to create cutting-edge solutions, whether it's optimizing algorithms, developing software applications, or tackling real-world problems.

<p>
  I look forward to the opportunities and 
  challenges that the future holds as I 
  bridge the worlds of mathematics and 
  software engineering, and I am eager 
  to make a positive impact on the 
  ever-evolving tech landscape.
